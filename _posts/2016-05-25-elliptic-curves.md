### Elliptic curves with complex multiplication give rise to tori over the complex numbers  

Completed in spring 2016 at the [Mathematical Computing Laboratory](http://mcl.math.uic.edu/) at UIC.  

This [repository](https://github.com/galenballew/Elliptic-Curves) contains the paper, poster, images, and 3d modeling files from my research and learning project on elliptic curves. I completed this project with James
Duncan under the guidance of Cara Mullen (PhD) and Professor Alina Cojocaru (PhD).

##### **Summary**

Our research focuses on elliptic curves \\(E\\) over \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) with complex
multiplication (by the maximal order of an imaginary quadratic
field). Viewed over \\(\mathbb{C}\\), each \\(E\\) gives rise to two tori, defined by
the generators \\(\omega_1\\) and \\(\omega_2\\) of the period lattice. These tori can be
constructed virtually into a 3D mesh. Further, this mesh can be
translated into gcode and printed using a 3D printer.
